        Key operating principles,

        • Growth strategies and associated financial plans, once agreed and
        approved by DMGT, provide the framework within which we expect Operating
        Companies to be run and inform how DMGT allocates capital.

        • Due to the impact each Operating Company’s own strategic plan has on
        DMGT’s fiscal budgeting process, growth strategies and budgets are to be
        prepared realistically,

        with a strong expectation of delivery.

        • DMGT closely tracks actual performance versus approved strategies and
        financial plans on a monthly basis via Performance Management
        Dashboards.

        • DMGT manages the Group in accordance with three portfolio roles –
        Operating at scale, Focused growth and Early bets – each with distinct
        performance objectives and contribution expectations. A robust
        articulation of DMGT’s portfolio roles is provided in DMGT’s 2018
        Investor Briefing.

        • The Strategy & Performance Management team is committed to supporting
        DMGT’s Operating Companies as they deliver performance outcomes in
        accordance with their particular

        Contacts

        Cameron Drinkwater, Director, Strategy & Performance Management
        (cameron.drinkwater@dmgt.com)

        portfolio role. This support is provided through DMGT’s Performance
        Improvement Programme (PIP).

        • DMGT’s long-term vision is ‘Intelligent Insights. Consumer
        Connections’, the intersection of our Consumer experience and our B2B
        opportunities. See DMGT’s FY2017 Year End Results and 2018 Investor
        Briefing presentation.

        • Over the long-term, the Strategy & Performance Management team will
        help DMGT take advantage of the opportunities presented by ‘Intelligent
        Insights. Consumer Connections’ through selective organic and inorganic
        investments, often in collaboration with DMGT’s Operating Companies and
        management.

        Action required

        • The PIP includes Playbooks of best practices and execution templates
        across five value creation levers: Product, Commercial, Technology,
        Operations and People. Strategy & Performance Management team members
        partner with DMGT’s Operating Companies to select and execute PIP
        initiatives that help to address

        the needs and ambitions of each company. For assistance developing and
        executing PIP initiatives or for access to the latest library of DMGT
        PIP Playbooks, contact the Director, Strategy & Performance Management.

        • Operating Company leadership are expected to keep the Strategy &
        Performance Management team informed of current strategic thinking and
        priorities, as well as any changes or challenges

        that may arise, through regular dialogue and updates. Monthly
        Performance Management Dashboards provide one regular touchpoint between
        Operating Company leadership and the Strategy & Performance Management
        team; questions arising from the Strategy & Performance Management team
        regarding the monthly dashboards are expected to be addressed in a
        timely and factual manner.

        Interactions with DMGT

        • Approval to execute against a given strategic plan will be provided by
        DMGT’s Executive Committee, Investment & Finance Committee and/or Board
        of Directors, in accordance with the quantum of investment required and
        degree of strategic pivot implied. Refer to the Approvals Limit table
        for further information.

        • Approvals should be sought via the Approvals meeting.

        • Should Operating Company leadership not wish to involve the Strategy &
        Performance Management team in PIP initiative or a strategic review,
        DMGT requires that the Director, Strategy & Performance Management be
        kept abreast of all work and be invited to provide input throughout.

        • Performance Management Dashboard KPIs should be set by Operating
        Company CEOs and CFOs and the Strategy & Performance Management team,
        with monthly discussions to update on strategic progress and any changes
        in trajectory.
